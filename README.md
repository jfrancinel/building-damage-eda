Exploratory Data Analysis of Earthquake Building Damage Dataset

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on an earthquake building damage dataset.
The analysis explores damage distribution, building materials, location-based damage patterns,
and the relationship between building age and damage severity.

## 📊 Dataset
