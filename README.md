Exploratory Data Analysis of Earthquake Building Damage Dataset

## Project Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on an earthquake building damage dataset.
The analysis explores damage distribution, building materials, location-based damage patterns,
and the relationship between building age and damage severity.

## Dataset
Source: Kaggle

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Visual Studio Code

## Key Analyses
- Damage class distribution
- Damage vs building material
- Damage by district
- Relationship between building age and damage

## Files
- `eda.ipynb` – main analysis notebook

## Notes
This project was created as part of a beginner data science learning journey, with the goal of practicing fundamental data analysis concepts such as data cleaning, exploration, and visualization using real-world data.
